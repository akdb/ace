To use ACE with your ASSS makefile, copy all files to src/ace/ in your ASSS
build environment.

Running make in src/ will then process all .aces files into .c files (kept in
the build/ directory as .acec files actually) and then into the appropriate .o
file. Remember to add your modules to the appopriate library .mk file as with
any other C module.

To use ACE manually, run "python ace.py --help" for more information.
